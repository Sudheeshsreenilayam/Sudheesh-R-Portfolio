# 🧠 Dissect With Sudheesh

Hi, I’m **Sudheesh Sreenilayam** — a Business Analytics grad student based in Chicago with 8+ years of experience in operations and customer success.

This is my portfolio of hands-on data science and business analytics projects. I’m currently building in **R**, and will be adding projects in **Python**, **SQL**, and **Tableau** soon.

## 💡 Why This Portfolio?

As a Business Analytics grad student with a background in operations, I created this space to:

- Practice and showcase my evolving data skillset
- Build real-world, self-explanatory projects
- Connect with like-minded data professionals and recruiters

I believe that **insights should speak for themselves**, and this site is a step in that direction.
