# 🧠 Dissect With Sudheesh

Hi, I’m **Sudheesh Sreenilayam** — a Business Analytics grad student based in Chicago with 8+ years of experience in operations and customer success.

This is my portfolio of hands-on data science and business analytics projects. I’m currently building in **R**, and will be adding projects in **Python**, **SQL**, and **Tableau** soon.
