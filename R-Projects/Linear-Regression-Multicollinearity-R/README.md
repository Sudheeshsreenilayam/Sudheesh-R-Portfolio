# 🧠 Understanding Multicollinearity in Linear Regression using R

This project explores how **multicollinearity** affects the interpretation of linear regression models using synthetic data. It demonstrates the behavior of correlated predictors, compares simple vs. multiple regression models, and shows how a single outlier can influence regression diagnostics.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Simulated two predictors: `x1` and `x2`, with high correlation (~0.83)
- Created a linear relationship with response variable `y`
- Compared regression models:
  - `y ~ x1`
  - `y ~ x2`
  - `y ~ x1 + x2`
- Added a **high-leverage outlier** and analyzed model diagnostics

## 💡 Key Learnings

- **Multicollinearity** can make a meaningful variable appear insignificant
- **Diagnostic plots** reveal leverage, residuals, and influence
- Always evaluate model assumptions and investigate anomalies visually
