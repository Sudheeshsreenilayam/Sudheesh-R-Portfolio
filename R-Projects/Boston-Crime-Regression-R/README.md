# 📊 Boston Crime Regression Analysis

This project explores the relationships between per capita crime rate and 13 socio-economic predictors using the Boston housing dataset from the `MASS` package. Each predictor was analyzed individually using simple linear regression to assess its impact on crime.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Performed simple linear regression of `crim` against each variable
- Summarized key statistics: coefficients, p-values, and R-squared
- Visualized top predictors using `ggplot2`
- Highlighted strongest relationships and interpretation

---

## 🧪 Key Findings

- **Rad** (access to highways), **nox** (pollution), and **dis** (distance to employment centers) had the strongest relationships with crime
- Positive correlation: more access to highways (rad) → higher crime
- Negative correlation: longer distance to work centers (dis) → lower crime
- Not all predictors were statistically significant
