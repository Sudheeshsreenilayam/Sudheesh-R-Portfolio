# 📁 Sudheesh's R Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of R-based analytics and machine learning projects. Each folder in this repository contains a self-contained project that demonstrates a specific concept or technique using R.

## 🔍 Projects Included

### 1. [Linear Regression with Multicollinearity](./Linear-Regression-Multicollinearity-R)

This project explores how multicollinearity can distort coefficient interpretation in regression models. It includes:

- Simulated correlated predictors
- Comparison of simple vs. multiple regression
- Impact of a high-leverage outlier
- Diagnostic plots for model evaluation

More projects will be added here as I continue exploring and building in R.
